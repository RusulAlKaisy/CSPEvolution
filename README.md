## About the project
The GitHub repository is part of my master's thesis in May 2024. The master thesis project focuses on assessing the molecular evolutionary history of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) by utilizing phylogenetic mixture models such as GHOST through extensive analysis and development of custom coding. 

## Software 
* Rstudio:4.2.3
* iqtree-2.2.2.6
 
## Repository structure
The repository contains all custom-developed code pertinent to the thesis project, as well as code utilized in the thesis preparation project (2023). 

* Data analysis: Contains code files related to data analysis. Related code files in the repository are the following: GHOST + iqtree_replicates_NOOutgroup (The genetic sequences only contains the species name, and do not include an outgroup)
