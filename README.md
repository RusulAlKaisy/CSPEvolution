## About the project
The GitHub repository is part of my master's thesis in May 2024. The master thesis project focuses on assessing the molecular evolutionary history of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) by utilizing phylogenetic mixture models such as GHOST through extensive analysis and development of custom coding. 

## Software 
* Rstudio:4.2.3
* iqtree-2.2.2.6
 
## Repository structure
The repository contains all custom-developed code pertinent to the thesis project and the thesis preparation project (2023). The code is segregated into different files based on their functionality or purpose. The repository holds code files for generating plots and visualization to represent the data. Furthermore, it contains code related to data analysis. The files are organized and labeled in accordance with the sequential steps as seen below on the flowchart
